/*
HASH FUNCTION
    My hash map is designed to store a string based on the firt letter of each word in alphabetical buckets. (inspired by bucket sort)
    The hash function takes a word as an input and does the following:
        - checks if the string is empty, end of function if it is empty
        - then converts the first letter to lower case and stores it
        - checks if the first letter is alphabetical (in English), end of function if it isn't
        - using this format "intial - 'a'" converts the first letter into an bucket index to be stored in hashmap, returns this index
        - there is NO RISK OF COLLISIONS as each bucket has it's own array - so I didn't really need to implement a seperate collision handling mechanism

MEMORY ALLOCATION
    Each bucket is an array. Adding new elements to the array reqiures proper memory allocation. Here is how my memory allocation mechanism works:
        - the initial capacity of each bucket is 0. This ensure that we aren't allocating any memory unlessit is needed
        - the "push_back" function which is designed to add new item to the back of the array. it checks if the current size is already equal to the allocated memory.
        - if the size is equal to the allocated memory it creates a new array with twice the capacity
        - transfers the old elements into the new array then cleans the old array and sets the old array to point at the new array created

SORTING
    To keep track of words common in the two files I created a new alphabetical hash table.
    When adding words to this everything gets mostly sorted so there isn't a huge amount of time spent afterwards on sorting.
    To sort each bucket I implemented heap sort. The reasons I chose heap sort over quick sort is:
        - the buckets are expected have approximatly 40ish elements in the worst case so there isn't significant difference in run time between the best case run time of Quick Sort which is O(n).
        - the worst case scenerio of quick sort performs way worse than heap sort and this might be the case for certain runs even if an element is picked completely randomly.
